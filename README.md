The CIFAR_dataset notebook is to build the Convolutional Neural Network from scratch, train and test it on the CIFAR dataset.

The Transfer Learning notebook is to use a pre-trained vgg16 model to caption the items still from the CIFAR dataset.

The Style Transfer Project is to create a fusion image which combines the features and contents from two images. I listed the two images I used as fire.jpg and lebron.jpg (He's the goat!), and the fusion image is result.jpg.
